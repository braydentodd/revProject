                    <p style="color:red;">
                        A rough, hard-nosed colony, the Hammers are proud of who they are.
                        They are practically self-sustainable thanks to their strong infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:red;">
                        Their pride and bluntness can tend to rub others the wrong way. The Chunks
                        especially have a grudge with them, as the Hammers have slowly encroached their way
                        into the Chunks' marked territory.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:red;">
                        But the Hammers were by far the greatest supplier of weapons, troops, and generals for the revelotion.
                        So everyone reluctantly treats them with a level of respect.

                    <p style="color:magenta;">
                        <i>Your homeland!</i> A rapidly blossoming colony of middle-class folks, the Chunks foster a close-knit community
                        with a booming, versatile economy.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:magenta;">
                        They have solid working relationships with the Eastern side colonies, except for the Nuggets who they
                        don't see a purpose for...
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:magenta;">
                        The Chunks operate with a more joyful sense of pride than the Hammers, but it is still very real. The
                        Revolution was sparked by the Chunks and they believe they are on the come up. They want their say in things.

                    <p style="color:tan;">
                        The elites of this island. The Waffles are the envy of everyone, due to just how dang wealthy this colony is.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:tan;">
                        Foreign nations primarily ship in and out of the Waffles' ports, and the Waffles struck gold, quite literally in
                        abandoned gold mines along the Nuggets-Waffles border that were previously thought to be fully scoured.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:tan;">
                        Nobody really has an issue with the Waffles. Everyone knows the notoriety they bring to the island. But the Waffles
                        don't interact much with the other colonies. Nobody's sure what to expect from them now.

                        <b>The Nuggets</b>
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:gold;">
                        This colony has seen better days. Once a robust mining colony, the Nuggets have significantly drained the local area of its resources.
                        Now they're onto lumber, but there are only so much trees...
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:gold;">
                        The Nuggets have shrank both land-wise and population-wise the last couple decades.
                        But the people here are nice enough. They are confident they can turn things around.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:gold;">
                        A very strong relationship with the Yetis is helping keep them afloat in multiple ways.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p style="color:cyan;">
                        Nestled along the SouthEastern coast, the Yetis boast a dynamic economy centered around fishing and hunting.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:cyan;">
                        Everyone likes the Yetis.
                        And the Yetis like to remain neutral, unless something involves the Nuggets, then they take their side.
                    </p>
                    <p style="color:cyan;">
                        Nobody really understands why they like the Nuggets so much, but they just kind of roll with it. Some theorize the Yetis
                        leverage their support to take advantage of the Nuggets.
