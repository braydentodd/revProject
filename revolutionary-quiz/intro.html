            <p>After roughly 400 years of rule by dictatorship, you have successfully
                gathered the backing of all 5 Lassian Colonies (shown in the image
                below) and broken free from the reign of the North Wollypog Empire!
            </p>

            <p>
                Now that the Lassian Colonies are a free people, they have some decisions to make.
                They would like to form a united nation after just winning the war together...
                but they are not without their differences...
            </p>
            <p>
                Lassians are a diverse group of people, made up of different cultures and motivated
                by different interests and ways of living. Each colony sports a different dynamic.
                <i> If a colony doesn't like the way their newfound nation is heading, they will
                    not shy away from breaking off to form their own separate entity.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                Following your heroic effort in rallying the colonies towards independence,
                they unanimously nominate you to lead the charge in constructing a future foundation
                for this new society. They trust you. For now...
