# revProject
A mini-game/quiz that simulates political decision-making

I made this project for a History course, where we were discussing all things revolution. This is an unfinished application where the user
is put in the position of a revolutionary leader who is now in charge of leading a group of colonies in the next steps of unification
following a successful revolution.
